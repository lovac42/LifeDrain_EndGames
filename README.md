# About:
A collection of end games for <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/715575551">LifeDrain</a>.

## Game Over Message
Displaying a boring message for game over.

## Pomodoro Timer
Shows a timer for breaks. 4 tomatoes is tea time.

## Death Date
Shows an ASCII graph of your elapsed time since birth compared to the average life expectancy. Depressing, but adds a dose of reality.

## Death Toll (Stackable)
When the number of death mounts up, Anki gets killed, losing all unsaved progress. This one is not for pussycats.
